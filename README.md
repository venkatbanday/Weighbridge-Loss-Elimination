Weighbridge Loss Elimination
**Weighbridge Variations**

Every loaded vehicle is weighed at the weighbridge. We have observed variations between standard calculations and actual weights recorded at the weighbridge. All fillings are conducted automatically, without manual interference; however, operators monitor calibration and make adjustments based on the actual weight checked manually according to SOP guidelines.

We cannot allow any material to be filled below the required weight, as this violates weighment regulations and could lead to penalties if discrepancies are found. On average, we have experienced a significant loss of materials each month.

**Steps Taken**

1. Conducted a comprehensive study of the entire operations.
2. Inspected the calibration of weighbridges within the factory. We established a system to check one vehicle against two different weighbridges and documented the differences for further analysis.
3. Reviewed the weighing scales used by the respective packing units and assessed their filled capacities.
4. Noted that the weighing scales had a larger capacity than the actual filling capacity. Larger capacity scales tend to exhibit greater variations, while smaller capacity scales show less variation.
5. Replaced the weighing scales with ones that more closely match the filling capacity.

After implementing these changes, the variation between the filling weights and the weighbridge weights significantly decreased. Consequently, we no longer incur additional losses, and the cost of the new weighing scales was recovered within two months by eliminating previous losses.

Weighbridge Loss Elimination

Conducted inter-system calibration audit across packing units and weighbridges. 
Right-sized weighing scales to product volume; eliminated overfill losses. 
Achieved ROI on new weighing systems within 2 months.
